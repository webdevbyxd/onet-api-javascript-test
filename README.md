# JavaScript Code Samples for O\*NET Web Services

`keyword_search.html` is a web page which demonstrates the occupation keyword search.

`keyword_search.js` provides the JavaScript code used in `keyword_search.html`.

`OnetWebService.js` is a utility class you may use in your own applications. This class, which is used by the keyword search example, uses the `fetch` API (in supported browsers) or `XMLHttpRequest` to connect to O\*NET Web Services.

## Running the example
